# Q4 - Association Analysis
---

Consider the following market basket transactions shown in the Table below.

Transaction ID | Items Ordered
--- | ---
1 | {Flour, Eggs, Bread}
2 | {Soda, Coffee}
3 | {Flour, Butter, Milk, Eggs}
4 | {Bread, Eggs, Juice, Detergent}
5 | {Bread, Milk, Eggs}
6 | {Eggs, Bread}
7 | {Detergent, Milk}
8 | {Coffee, Soda, Juice}
9 | {Butter, Juice, Bread}
10 | {Milk, Bread, Detergent}

## Import Libraries


```python
from pprint import pprint
import itertools
import math
```

## (a) How many items are in this data set? What is the maximum size of itemsets that can be extracted from this data set?

### Transaction History


```python
transactions = [(1, frozenset({'Flour', 'Eggs', 'Bread'})),
                (2, frozenset({'Soda', 'Coffee'})),
                (3, frozenset({'Flour', 'Butter', 'Milk', 'Eggs'})),
                (4, frozenset({'Bread', 'Eggs', 'Juice', 'Detergent'})),
                (5, frozenset({'Bread', 'Milk', 'Eggs'})),
                (6, frozenset({'Eggs', 'Bread'})),
                (7, frozenset({'Detergent', 'Milk'})),
                (8, frozenset({'Coffee', 'Soda', 'Juice'})),
                (9, frozenset({'Butter', 'Juice', 'Bread'})),
                (10, frozenset({'Milk', 'Bread', 'Detergent'})),
               ]
```

### Count of Items


```python
items = set()
for i, x in transactions:
    items.update(x)
print('Total items in the data set - {}'.format(len(items)))
print('The items are - {}'.format(items))
```

```shell
Total items in the data set - 9
The items are - {'Juice', 'Flour', 'Detergent', 'Eggs', 'Bread', 'Milk', 'Soda', 'Butter', 'Coffee'}
```


### Itemsets with Support ≥ 1


```python
itemsets = {}
for i in range(1, len(items)+1):
    for x in itertools.combinations(items, i):
        for _, y in transactions:
            if set(x).issubset(y):
                if frozenset(x) not in itemsets:
                    itemsets[frozenset(x)]=0
                itemsets[frozenset(x)]+=1
print('Total itemsets with support ≥ 1 are - {}'.format(len(itemsets)))
```

```shell
Total itemsets with support ≥ 1 are - 44
```

```python
print('Maximum Size of Itemset - {}'.format(max([len(x) for x in itemsets.keys()])))
```

```shell
Maximum Size of Itemset - 4
```

**There are 9 unique items, and 44 itemsets with with support ≥ 1, with maximum number of items in an itemset being 4.**



## (b) What is the maximum number of association rules that can be extracted from this data (including rules that have zero support)?


```python
cnt=math.pow(3,len(items))-math.pow(2,len(items)+1)+1
print('The maximum number of association rules that can be extracted are {:.0f}'.format(cnt))
```

```shell
The maximum number of association rules that can be extracted are 18660
```

**The maximum number of association rules that can be generated using $$d$$ distinct items is given by the following formula - $$R = \sum_{k=1}^{d-1}[{d \choose k} \times \sum_{j=1}^{d-k}{d-k \choose j}] = 3^d - 2^{d+1} + 1$$. If we plugin $$d=9, R=18660.$$ **



## (c) What is the maximum number of 2-itemsets that can be derived from this data set (including those have zero support)?


```python
print('The maximum number of 2-itemsets that can be derived from this data set are {:.0f}'.format(
    math.factorial(len(items))/(math.factorial(len(items)-2)*2)))
```

```shell
The maximum number of 2-itemsets that can be derived from this data set are 36
```

**The maximum number of 2-itemsets that can be derived using $$n$$ distinct items is given by the following combination - $$count = {n \choose 2} = \frac{n!}{n!2!} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$$. For 9 items, we get 36 2-itemsets.**



## (d) Find an itemset (of size 2 or larger) that has the largest support.


```python
max_cnt=0
max_set=None
for x,cnt in itemsets.items():
    if len(x)>=2 and cnt>max_cnt:
        max_cnt=cnt
        max_set=x
print('The itemset of size 2 or larger with maximum support is -> {' + ', '.join(max_set) + '}')
```

    The itemset of size 2 or larger with maximum support is -> {Bread, Eggs}

**We can calculate this by iterating over the all the itemsets, and checking itemsets which have support more than or equal to 2. We can then maintain a MAX variable to keep track of the set which has the maximum support. Using this approach we get the following itemset -> {Bread, Eggs} and its support is 4 or $$\frac{4}{10} = 0.4$$ . **



## (e) Given minconf = 0.5, find two pairs of items, a and b, such that the rules {a} -> {b} and {b} -> {a} have the same confidence, and their confidence is greater than or equal to the minconf threshold.


```python
s = set(itemsets.keys())
for x, y in itertools.combinations(s, 2):
    union = x.union(y)
    if union in itemsets and itemsets[x]==itemsets[y] and itemsets[union]/itemsets[x]>=0.5:
        print('Confidence -> {:.2f}\t'.format(itemsets[union]/itemsets[x]),
              '[{}]'.format(', '.join(x)),
              '[{}]'.format(', '.join(y)))
```

**The formula for confidence is given by $$confidence(X -> Y) = \frac{support(X \cup Y)}{support(X)}$$. Given 2 itemsets, x and y, the confidence(x->y) and confidence(y->x) is equal if and only if the their individual supports are equal.**

**We listed out above all the possible pair of itemsets have a confidence ≥ 0.5 and have the same confidence.**

**If we assume $$a$$ and $$b$$ are items, then the question states to find 2 such pairs of 1-itemsets. From the above list these are [{Flour} {Butter}] and [{Soda}{Coffee}].**

**If we assume $$a$$ and $$b$$ are 2-itemsets, then the questions asks us to find a pair of 2-itemsets that satisfy the above condition. From the above list, this is [{Butter, Eggs}, {Flour, Milk}]**
